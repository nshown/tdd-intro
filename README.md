**Test Driven Development** (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes creating tests to verify a software's requirements.  In TDD the tests are written first to describe the functionality of your application's code.  Tests are then run to insure that they fail.  Then an engineer creates code that will satisfy the tests.  Any additional functionality or alterations to the tests are made.  A new cycle of tests is then begun.

By developing software in this matter you can ensure that it is less error prone, more maintainable, cleaner code.  Tests also function as an excellent source of documentation for what your application is doing that is more thorough than simple text or comments.
